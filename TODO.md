# TODO for Adding Counter Effects to Stats in index.html

1. [x] Edit index.html: Modify the three stat spans in the #achievements section to set initial text to "0" and add class "counter" and data-target attributes with the respective values (200, 90, 4480).
2. [x] Edit index.html: Add the JavaScript code for the counter animation using Intersection Observer in the existing script tag at the bottom.
3. [x] Test the implementation: Use browser_action to launch and verify the counter effects trigger on scroll.
