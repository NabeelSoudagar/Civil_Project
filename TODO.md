# TODO: Add Landline and WhatsApp to Footer Contact Info

## Information Gathered
- The footer appears in 12 HTML files: index.html, aboutus.html, achievements.html, construction.html, execution.html, feedback.html, gallery.html, getintouch.html, internship.html, post_execution.html, pre-construction.html, rainwaterharvesting.html
- Each footer has a "Contact Us" section (right side in the grid layout) with a list of links.
- The task is to add "Landline: 0831-3553030" and "WhatsApp: 7795615084" as additional list items in this section.

## Plan
- For each HTML file, locate the "Contact Us" ul in the footer.
- Add two new <li> elements: one for Landline and one for WhatsApp, after the existing links.
- Ensure the additions are consistent across all files.
